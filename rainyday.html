            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>No financial gibberish, light on formalities, heavy on real-life utility and connection. The Rainy day mobile app functions as a financial advisor, tracking the user’s money movements with a particular focus on saving goals.</p>

                <h3>“Our brains have not developed for the purpose of making clever financial decisions.” <span>(Mira
                        Fauth-Bühler,
                        Professor of Economic Psychology and Neuroeconomics)</span></h3>
                <p>Rainy day tries to build a plain-worded and trustworthy financial foundation for people. A tool that
                    empathizes
                    with real-life needs in a world where information overload and stimuli are abundant.</p>
                <h3>“Looking at images on a vision board primes the brain to grasp opportunities that could go unnoticed (...) a
                    process called ‘value-tagging’ which imprints important things onto your subconscious and filters out
                    unnecessary information.” <span>(Dr Tara Suart, Neuroscientist)</span></h3>
                <p>Therefore, to help users save money while establishing Goals, the interface should be visually rich. The user
                    should have each Goal identified by a chosen image that
                    will work as a ‘value-trigger’ and, ultimately, fulfill the objective.</p>

            <p>Rainy Day aims to be a financial shelter, a close supporting hand wherever and whenever finance is concerned. No
                formal mumbo-jumbo, no cryptic stats or crypto dross. We just help you save money for those special expenses
                that come once or thrice in life, come rain or shine.

            <p>This attitude reflected a simple approach to the brand’s logo. A bold expression, slight touches of personality
                but nevertheless simple. The symbol is an extension of the protection of the user’s goals. A rainbow if you will,
                financial hope. </p>
        
            <p>In a future iteration, an in-app insurance plan to cover goals could be pertinent. </p>

            <p>Logo: The spacing is based on the letter i as a base unit; Vertical padding = “i height/2”; horizontal padding
                “90º i”. The only upper case letter on the logo is the initial R. Colored versions have been made and tested on WCAG
                standards. When needed the logo can also be applied on the colored box responding to its previous spacing rules.
                These colors are always defined according to Brand Guidelines.</p>

        <div>
            <p>The Mid-Fi Prototype was tested with 5 participants, providing a key scenario and context for the mobile app. 
                The identified issues were addressed - ranging from readability concerns to navigation problems -, proceeding to the Hi-Fi Wireframes and final mockups.</p>
        
            <p>Provided Scenario: You’ve downloaded and logged in to the Rainy day app to start improving your financial
                management. Now, you have arrived at the home screen’s dashboard and want to add a new saving goal, establishing
                a budget and a date for that said goal.</p>
            
            <p>Design corrections:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Revised general copy and mathematical typos for better understanding (Goals %);</li>
            <li>Text size was revised and tested again;</li>
            <li>Revised the amount component when adding a goal to 6 digits. Target-wise, I did not consider the 1% of
                population that could manage one-million budgets but, even so, designed for that edge-case;</li>
            <li>Revised whole iconography for navigation and logo system to be more consistent and simple;</li>
            <li>Removed mobile breadcrumb component for desktop breakpoint design, while maintaining a progress bar throughout the
                goal flow;</li>
            <li>Overlay was added to the Hi-Fi Prototype on the goal’s detail screen which allows the user to edit or remove the
                goal. This function is not immediately accessible on the “My Goals” overview screen since it could induce easily
                accessible errors after saving so much money;</li>
            <li>Revised general button size.</li>

            <h2>7. Reflections</h2>
        </div>

        <p>During my 5 weeks Rainy day journey, a lot has happened. I felt the need to thoroughly examine the competitor space
            on each advancing task, hands-on through a myriad of apps (N26, Revolut, Qapital, Chime), while iterating on the branding aspects many times. Ultimately I felt the need to consult my mentor
            to consolidate my color system and card design anatomy which had to function on odd and even numbers on a responsive grid.</p>
        <p>While working on the desktop page, the project finally felt more solid. A brand voice, coming from my copywriting
            experience, helped me feel that the project breathed some manner of life and on a final instance would help me on my
            transition to become a UI/UX Designer acknowledging my previous experience. With more time and necessary user feedback, I’d like to design the Stats and Wallet
            Flow on a 2nd iteration. I also believe that many focal technicalities should be addressed (from payment information
            linkage to the important settings that a financial app must have as crystal-clear).</p>
